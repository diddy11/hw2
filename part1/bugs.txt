1. XSS attack: In gift.html and item-single.html, we can see that there is parameter called "director" which can be attacked by reflected XSS,
               so I made a get request "http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift.html?director=<script>alert('this is a XSS attack!');</script>"

2. CSRF attack: To make another user to gift a gift card to your account without their knowledge. We can make a CSRF attack by creating a fake html to let victim click this URL,
                and then in this csrf.html I write some malicious javascript codes which can make a post request and as long as csrf.html is loaded, the
                code will execute to complete the attack

3. SQL injection: I create a .gtfcrd file and modified signature field by using 'union select' to find all passwords of users.

4. command injection: In use.html, a command injection attack can be exploited by entering "; touch pwned; exit;" in input box.
                      The system terminal will execute this linux command line by line, if an attacker uses "rm" command instead of "touch pwned" command, lots of important files
                      will be deleted!
